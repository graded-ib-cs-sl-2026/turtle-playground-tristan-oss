# Turtle Swing Code

This code packages up the Turtle Swing code that is packaged with the [CS Awesome curriculum](https://www.csawesome.org) as a Github Template. 

## How to get a copy for yourself


### Option 1

Click the "Use this Template" button to make your own copy of the code. Then open the code the way you would any github project (using Github Desktop, the built-in github tools in Eclipse or VS Code, etc)

### Option 2

Teachers can select this as starter code for a Github Classroom assignment. Unfortunately since it uses desktop graphics, Codespaces will not work out of the box, so it will need to be paired with a local IDE or using Gitpod. 

## How to load it once you have it

You can open it locally using the git tools built into VS Code or other IDEs such as eclipse or netbeans, or with Github desktop. This will require you to have a functional java installation.

Alternatively, you can open it using [GitPod](https://gitpod.io). A Gitpod configuration file is included that will let it open correctly with desktop support and everything.
